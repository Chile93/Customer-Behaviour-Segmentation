# Customer-Behaviour-Segmentation

This project explores customer behavior segmentation using three distinct clustering models; K-Means, DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering in R-studio applied to the Mall Customer Dataset. The primary objective is to understand and categorize customer behavior based on their spending patterns and demographic attributes and suggest the best model for customer segmentation and recommendations. .

The dataset, containing information such as customer age, annual income, and spending score, undergoes preprocessing steps like scaling or normalization. Subsequently, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering, and K-Means algorithms are applied to cluster customers into distinct segments.

Evaluation metrics and visualizations, including scatter plots, pair plots, and cluster comparison charts, are utilized to assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated clusters. The study compares the performance of these models in identifying coherent customer segments, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling varying shapes and sizes of clusters, noise, and outliers within the dataset.

This investigation aims to provide insights into the diverse approaches of customer segmentation using different clustering methodologies, offering guidance on the most suitable model for extracting meaningful and actionable customer behavior patterns from the Mall Customer Dataset.
